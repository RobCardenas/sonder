# Project 3 Feedback

## Project Strengths

* I'm very impressed with the functionality of storing multiple photos and the draft feature.
* Nice design and user experience. Looks very professional!
* Good use of partials and Rails helpers throughout.
* Frequent and descriptive commit messages.
* Informative and organized `README`.

## Areas of Improvement

* See code comments marked with `CJ`
* Consider adding an `.example_env` file NOT included in your `.gitignore` that lists examples of the secret keys you used. This will help other devs to know when environment variables they need when pulling down the code. Something like this:

  ```ruby
  # .example_env
  S3_BUCKET=YOUR_S3_BUCKET
  S3_KEY=YOUR_S3_KEY
  ```
